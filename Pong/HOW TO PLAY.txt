HOW THE GAME WORKS:
	This is a 2 player game where the palyers use the keyboard to control a paddle on either side of the screen.
	The goal of the game is for each player to move their paddles to block a ball from reaching their side of the screen.
	If the ball reaches a players side then the opposing player gains 1 point.
	The ball is then placed back in the middle and once a player moves a paddle then the ball is served towards the
		player that got scored on.
	Once a player reaches the amount of points needed to win (by default 3, but this can be changed in the settings)
		then the player is declared the winner and the game must be exited.
	The date of each game and the winner is also recorded in the GameLog.txt file

CONTROLS:
	The player on the left uses the "w" key to move the paddle up, and the "s" key to move the paddle down.
	The player on the right uses the "up arrow" key to move the paddle up, and the "down arrow" key to move the paddle down.

SETTINGS:
	The settings of the game can be changed by editing the "settings.txt" document. The settings include:
		The color of the paddle
		The color of the ball
		The color of the background
		The left players name
		The right players name
		The x and y speed of the ball
